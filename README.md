# Documentation Repository

This repo houses publicly available documentation for Portage Labs projects.

## Getting Started

### For Project Managers

Start by reading through our [Non-Technical Summary](docs/SUMMARY.md#non-technical-summary) documentation section.

Our development works as a simplified [Agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) approach; specifically, we use the [Linear Method](https://linear.app/method) with [Cycles](https://linear.app/docs/use-cycles) replacing Agile's sprints.

- Managers are responsible for top-level project direction, feature road maps, prioritizing and linking issues (tickets), and fitting those issues into the scope of each cycle.
- Developers are responsible for creating well-documented issues, scoping them with [estimates](https://linear.app/docs/estimates) (where 1 point = one day), and keeping managers informed when there are delays or some time to tackle [tech debt](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/technical-debt/) is necessary.

### For Developers

You should be looking at our **\[secret project\]**'s documentation, not these public docs.
